    <p>ML4H 2020 invites submissions describing innovative machine learning research focused on relevant problems in health and biomedicine. Similar to the previous year, ML4H 2020 will both accept papers for a formal proceedings as well as accepting traditional, non-archival extended abstract submissions. Authors are invited to submit works for either track provided the work fits within the purview of Machine Learning for Health. In addition, we especially solicit works that speak to this year's ML4H theme: Advancing Healthcare for All.</p>
<p>We are also piloting mentorship programs for authors and reviewers. See <a href="https://ml4health.github.io/pages/mentorship.html">https://ml4health.github.io/pages/mentorship.html</a> for additional details.</p>
<h4>Timeline</h4>
<p>Paper submission deadline: Sep 9<br />
Author notification: Sep 30<br />
Camera-ready papers due: Nov 1</p>

<h4>Managing conflicts of interest</h4>
<p>We will use the Microsoft CMT system to enforce the following policy: any reviewer (including the organizers) cannot be involved in the assessment of a submission from someone (1) who has been a colleague with the reviewer within the same organization in the past 3 years; (2) who has co-authored publications with the reviewer in the past 3 years.
</p>
<h4>Discouraging presentation of already finalized work</h4>
<p>In our call for papers, we will strictly emphasize that only unpublished drafts or preprints will be considered for reviewing. We will guide the reviewers to search the titles of the submission in Google. If a submission is identified to be significantly overlapped with a published work, it will be desk-rejected.</p> 
<h4>Format and goal</h4>
<p>Our workshop will be in large-attendance talk format. The expected number of attendees is about 150. The goal of such a format is to bring together SSL-interested researchers with expertise in theoretical machine learning, CV, NLP, time-series, graphs, robotics, etc.. By providing a platform that fosters potential discussions and collaborations between attendees, we want to bolster the development of the theoretical foundation of SSL and the theory-driven design of practically more effective SSL approaches.</p> 
<h4>Allowing for choice of attendance based on content</h4>
<p>We will collect the talk titles and abstracts from our confirmed speakers and will post them on our workshop website. We will also post a link to the camera-ready version of the accepted workshop papers on our website at the earliest to enable the attendants and online viewers to browse these papers in advance for deciding whether to attend.</p>

<p><b>Differentiation with previous workshops</b> Workshop 1-3 are about SSL, but focus on developing empirically effective SSL approaches without paying attention to their theoretical understandings. Our workshop focuses on establishing the theoretical foundation of SSL and providing theoretical insights for developing new SSL approaches. Workshop 3 and 4 aim to achieve sample efficiency in machine learning, but the approaches are not based on SSL.</p>
