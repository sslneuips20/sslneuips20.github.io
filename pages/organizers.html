<p><h4>Organizational experience and ability of the team </h4>
The organizer team has strong records of organizing large and complex events. Eric Xing organized ICML 2014 and 2019, as program co-chair and general chair respectively. Pulkit Agrawal organized a tutorial on ICVGIP and was on the program committee of NeurIPS Deep RL workshop for multiple years. He has served as an area chair for CoRL 2019 and is serving as an area chair for NeurIPS 2020 and CoRL 2020. Ishan Misra co-organized a workshop around self-supervised and weakly supervised learning at ICCV 2019 which had over 200 attendees, and the Facebook AI Self-supervised Learning Challenge in 2019. Cynthia Rudin is past chair of the INFORMS Data Mining Section and ASA Statistical Learning and Data Science Section. Shanghang Zhang organized the 1st and 2nd ICML workshop on “Human-in-the-loop Learning”. Abdelrahman Mohamed is a special session co-organizer about "New Trends in self-supervised speech processing" at Interspeech 2020. Wenzhen Yuan served as co-organizers of multiple workshops at Robotics: Science and Systems (RSS) and International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA). Barret Zoph has served as the co-organizer of multiple workshops at Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR) and International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV). Pengtao Xie organized multiple technical retreats and data hackathons, in his role of associate vice president at Petuum Inc. </p>

<p><h4>Organizer team’s research experience in SSL</h4>
Pulkit Agrawal proposed the use of egomotion for learning visual features [1,2]. He developed robot-learning methods that rely on SSL to push objects [3], manipulate ropes [4], navigate [5]. Pulkit’s work has also demonstrated how SSL  is a powerful tool to encourage exploration in reinforcement learning settings [6]. Ishan Misra proposed self-supervised learning approaches based on contrasting cluster assignments [7], maximizing cross-modal agreement [8], temporal order verification [11], etc. He proposed SSL approaches to learn pretext-invariant representations [9] and developed methods [10] to scale up SSL approaches. Pengtao Xie developed contrastive SSL methods for language understanding [12]. Pengtao Xie and Shanghang Zhanag analyzed the comparative advantages of SSL and transfer learning (TL) under different influential factors [13] and developed an approach integrating SSL and TL for screening COVID-19 from CT scans [14]. Abdelrahman Mohamed developed a benchmark [15] for automatic speech recognition with limited or no supervision and proposed SSL approaches [16] for speech recognition. Cynthia Rudin proposed an SSL approach which performs latent space exploration of generative models for photo upsampling.  Barret Zoph performed comparative studies of self-training and pretraining. Eric Xing and Wenzhen Yuan have conducted numerous works on unsupervised learning and weakly-supervised learning.
